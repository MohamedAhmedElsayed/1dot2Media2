We have been proudly selected as the appointed company by the official news agency in UAE (WAM) to develop and revamp their online presence. Through the entire project process, our teams were tightly integrated to understand the WAMâ€™s needs, identify workflow constraints and requirements, and harmonize our designs into new and developing storytelling formats. Working closely with the WAM different teams, there was a smooth transition from design into development, shaping and optimizing our final deliverables to meet their needs and process.
